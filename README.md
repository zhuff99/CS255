## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The driverPass Project is a system that allows for users to improve upon their driving skills. It achieves this by allowing users to sign up for tests, sign up for driving lessons with certified instructors, and study practice guides. The clients will be students who are looking to pass their driving test the first time around!

## What did you do particularly well?

I believe my UML diagrams (for the most part) were done pretty well. They laid out the system in a way that would be very easy for a developer to follow and begin working off of. 


## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would want to revise my sequence diagram on the project 2 outline. It was very rushed and I didn't fully understand exactly what needed to be achieved with it.


## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


I simply ready through the interview that was given in the earlier chapters and was able to base my design off of that. The owner had a fairly good idea of what kind of system he wanted and what the users were looking for.


## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I tend to write out each class/method and how they will work together. The smaller things such as variables and arithmetic I will just come up with while I am typing the code out.
